# UoB Estates AR app

This repository contains the whole progress of the project for unit COMS20006: Software Engineering Project.

## general info

The UoBAR app is a mobile app using QRcode and/or AR to bring the historical buildings and gardens (like gardens of Royal Fort and Goldney Hall) to life for both students and members of the public.

by scanning the QR code of the current location through the app which linked to the special website, visitor can browse the related introduction of the artwork without an in person guide.

At the same time, taking into account the different visitors, this app will also add corresponding audio, video and other introduction materials to meet different needs

The app will be progressive and maintainable, preparing the client to expand the scope of application after the app is complete

## Stakeholders

Developers
  As developer we impact the system by creating the project and help make it maintainable as well as usable.

Students
  They are an indirect stakeholder as they are a target focus of the app, allowing newer students to get used to the area as well as giving more insight into the history and 
  culture of the area through public art.
  
Tourists
  Much like the students, they are an indirect stakeholder whose interest is in the final product as they would use the application in order to find out more about the public art   as well as helping them with the navigation of the area.
  
Bristol IT
	After we are done with the project, the maintenance of the servers would be handed over to the IT services and therefore they have a vested interest in the project.
